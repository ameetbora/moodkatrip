MoodKaTrip is an unique mobile app which is designed to recommend places of interest based on Social Media sentiment analysis.

Based on the current sentiment analysis through Facebook and some questionnaire filled by the user, he/she is presented with point of 
interest recommendation.

This project is still in development.
